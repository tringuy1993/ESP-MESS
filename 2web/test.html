            <p class="TextH1">1, What is ESP-MESS?</p>
            <p class="Text1">ESP-MESS is an open-source firmware for ESP8266 and 
                ESP32 microcontrollers, enabling rapid DIY (Do It Yourself) IoT
                prototyping for home automation, smart farming, smart business, and more.</p>

            <p class="TextH1">2, Why use ESP-MESS?</p>
            <p class="Text1">Because it's Kool! Get it? It's very Kool.</p>

            <p class="TextH1">3, Why does it matter to me?</p>
            <p class="Text1">Because machines run the world. And it's a good idea to 
                understand how it works, so that we can learn and adapt to 
                the rapid changes ahead. One way to do this is to experiment with
                systems like ESP-MESS.</p>

            <p class="TextH1">4, Is it complicate? Do I need to learn how to code?</p>
            <p class="Text1">Of course it is. But no worries, ESP-MESS is here to make 
                it easy like strawberries. Our goal is to provide methods to help you
                get started with zero line of code.</p>

            <p class="TextH1">5, What can ESP-MESS do?</p>
            <p class="Text1">ESP-MESS allows many ESP devices to communicate with each other
                wirelessly. You can configure devices to perform different tasks such as collecting
                sensors data or send commands to different ESP devices to instruct them to perform
                certain functions that are available to ESP-MESS enabled devices.</p>

            <p class="TextH1">6, How can I use ESP-MESS?</p>
            <p class="Text1">You need an ESP8266 or an ESP32 development board.<br>
                Download the ESP-MESS binary and flash it with the ESP-MESS binary.
                After that you can connect different supported components and configure
                it to perform available functions.</p>

            <p class="TextH1">7, What about hardware? Where can I get the hardware? 
                Are they readily available?</p>
            <p class="Text1">Most of the parts can be purchased on Amazon, Ebay, or Aliexpress.
                In order to connect the components, you can use an ESP-MESS baseboard. Or you 
                can connect them on a breadboard. Yuck.</p>
            
            <p class="TextH1">Enough BS. Now show me a simple example of ESP-MESS working.</p>
